<p data-start="1471" data-end="1811">The American Airlines app is more than just a digital boarding pass. It&rsquo;s a full-service portal where you can check flight status, manage your booking, receive gate updates, and even chat with customer service. Once you&rsquo;re logged in, navigating to the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section will offer options to initiate a live chat or schedule a call-back.</p>
<h3 data-start="1813" data-end="1850">3. <strong data-start="1820" data-end="1850">Reach Out via Social Media</strong></h3>

<h3 data-start="3877" data-end="3925">9. <strong data-start="3884" data-end="3925">Write to Their Corporate Headquarters</strong></h3>
